The installer will take you through the steps for setting up the Radeon ProRender Blender addon.

A key is required for installing the addon.  A prompt will be shown with a web page that will allow you  to acquire the key.

After the installation process completes successfully, run the postinstall application to connect the Radeon ProRender addon with the Blender distribution you choose.

Additionally, the uninstall application can be run at a later time to remove the Radeon ProRender addon from the Blender distribution that you choose.

The postinstall and uninstall applications can be found on the installer dmg.

Thank you for installing Radeon ProRender.
