Every issue should include 3 things:
1.  System setup (GPU, CPU, OS version, Blender version)
2.  **Most ideally** a .blend scene to reproduce this simply.  **SCREENSHOTS OR RENDERS ARE NOT A SCENE FILE**
3.  What the expected behavior or effect is.  If possible include the error message.  

You can get more information on the error message by opening Window -> Show System Console from blender and copying that text here.  On MacOS launch Blender from the Terminal.
